## Overview

This application implements the aircraft queueing problem in javascript/html/css.

Problem:
```

A software subsystem of an air-traffic control system is defined to manage a queue of aircraft (AC) in an airport. The aircraft queue is managed by a process which responds to three types of requests:

system boot used to start the system. enqueue aircraft used to insert a new AC into the system. dequeue aircraft used to remove an AC from the system. AC’s have the following properties:

AC type: Passenger or Cargo
  AC size: Small or Large
  The process which manages the queue of AC’s satisfies the following:


There is no limit on the number of AC’s it can manage Dequeue aircraft requests result in selection of one AC for removal such that: Passenger AC’s have removal precedence over Cargo AC’s Large AC’s of a given type have removal precedence over Small AC’s of the same type.

Earlier enqueued AC’s of a given type and size have precedence over later enqueued AC’s of the same type and size. Deliverable:


  
Your HTML page should have a button to boot the system,
  Selector(s) to enqueue aircraft,
  A button to dequeue aircraft (when pressed a message stating which aircraft was dequeued)
  There should be a tab or link to take the user to another view that shows the current state of the enqueued airplanes.
   
```
